# Starting a level

Here are a few simple steps to start out with each time you start a new level.

## 1. Picking music
To load music, the button on the toolbar that looks like
a music note. You can load in .mp3, .ogg, and .wav type files. It is recommended
to use the Ogg Vorbis file format.

## 2. Find the First Beat of the song

Use the waveform view to find your **First Beat**. You can play back the song and set other markers, like loop points.

## 3. Set where this First Beat starts

Now that you've set the First Beat in the Adjust Music dialog, you may also set the
**Music Sync** point on the track.
The **First Beat** you set will play EXACTLY when the playback marker passes the Music Sync marker.
Syncing your music is easy!

## 4. Getting the tempo
Click the button with a hand touching ripples
to open the Tapalong menu. Start the playback, and start pressing **`T`**
to tap along. The predicted tempo will be shown below. You should aim
for around 50 or more inputs to get a reliable average.

Set your found tempo by first pressing **`HOME`** to jump back to beat zero,
select the Tempo Change tool with the button on the right side,
and change the Starting BPM.

Ideally, you should set your BPM by adding a tempo change where the **Music 1st Beat**
marker is, since it will *always* be synced at that point.

## 5. Add blocks
Now you've come to the creative part -- adding the patterns. Use the block
selector at the top middle to place blocks. Blocks are what determine the events in the game.
